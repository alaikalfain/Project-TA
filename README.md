# Project title
# Frequency Monitoring Interface Design and System using HackRF

# Installation
# Extract the Program.zip, and then use local server app like XAMPP or similar app to operate the program

# Open the paper and poster for further explanation

# Note : because there is limitation max file upload (100 files) which my total program file is more much than that, so i decided to just upload the zip
